🐾 Project Title:

AI-Based Pet Disease Detection Using Image Classification

🧩 Objective:

To develop a machine learning–based web application that can analyze pet images and detect visible signs of skin diseases at an early stage.

💡 Problem Statement:

Pet skin diseases often go unnoticed until they become severe. Early detection can prevent complications and improve treatment outcomes. The goal is to build an intelligent system that automatically classifies diseases from images of pets.

⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React.js for advanced UI)

Backend: Flask, Python, AI & ML (PyTorch / Keras)

Image Processing: OpenCV

IDE / Editor: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook.
🧠 Methodology:

Collect and preprocess pet disease images.

Train a deep learning model using CNN (PyTorch/Keras).

Save the trained model as disease_classifier.pkl.

Build a Flask web app (app.py) for image upload and prediction.

Display the detected disease name on the web interface.

🎯 Outcome:

A functional web-based tool that identifies pet skin diseases from uploaded images, providing quick, AI-driven insights for early diagnosis.
